# CS-250-Project
Final Project for CS-250-H4876 Software Development Lifecycle 21EW4

When it comes to user needs you can either research reviews on what consumers find useful in similar applications as yours and what turns them off, so you have a list on what to avoid. Another great way to get immediate feedback is to hire a group of testers and or consumers at the start of the project planning to gauge the interest on what people would expect from the product.
Creating user stories then allows you to conceptualize the information found and turn it into something that is digestible by a team. When it comes to actual development, the creators do not need to know everything that was thought of in the pitch meeting, but a user story to know what is pressing and important and a format to turn the story into code or any other form of development. 
During the development of programs, I like to make sure I am constantly testing every time I add a significant code block. The agile process of test-driven development and continuous integration is something I hope to go more into and develop good habits and practices for. 
To be a good member of a team in software development is to be a good communicator throughout the life cycle of the project. I think my biggest take away from learning about Scrum and other agile teams is that there is always a team that has many forms of communicating and holding each other accountable to make sure the job gets done.
